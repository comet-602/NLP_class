(it had to be charged for about 2 hours before it could be registered...) i simply had to press the \"mute\" button on my base unit and then press the \"play\" button on the phone (the registration directions were even displayed on the lcd display on the phone!) please know that i did find the panasonic instaltion manual/registration directions to be a little confusing.\n",
